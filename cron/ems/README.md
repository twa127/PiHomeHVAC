# EMS Bus

Experimental support for control of Worcester Bosch type boilers using EMS 2-wire bus.

In order to send and receive commands to and from the serial interface a 'stub' is required:
  
1. Compile using - sudo gcc emsctl_2.c -o emsctl
2. Make executable using - sudo chmod +x emsctl
3. Make available using - sudo cp emsctl /usr/bin

## rc10_control.py

The 'rc10_control.py' Python script is used to capture EMS bus values and populate the MaxAir 'messages_in' queue. It :

1. Reads table 'ebus_messages' to identify sensors linked to EMS commands and their associated commands.
2. Sends each command using 'emsctl r command' and captures the response message.
3. Process the response message to capture the the first item in any multi-part response and convert any text response to a numeric value, e.g 'off' will be converted to 0 and 'on' to 1.
4. Add any required offset value to the response value.
5. Add the response value to the 'messages_in' queue.
6. Update the associated 'nodes' table 'last_seen' field.
7. Check if the associated sensor is to be graphed and if so add the response value to the 'sensor_graphs' table.
